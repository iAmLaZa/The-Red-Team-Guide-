# Red Teaming and Red Teams Overview

## Contributor: Tony Kelly @infosectdk

### What is a Red Team, and where did it come

The origins of Red Teams are military in origin. It was realised that to better defend there was a
need to attack your own defences to find weak points that could then be defended better. This
morphed into “War Games” where defenders or friendly forces were denoted as BLUE and the
opposing forces were RED.

Red Teaming was seen as a useful tool for generals to evaluate their security posture, Red Team
therefore took on the role of the aggressors or “bad guys”. The bad guys do not follow the rules
but utilized in a controlled way simulating and emulating what the bad guys can do, Red
Teaming serves to help the defenders spot, respond and stop attacks as well as strengthen and
improve

**To better defend therefore you need to know how to attack and to stop that attack.**


Red Teaming is what most refer to as Penetration Testing. In the realm of Information Security,
Red Teaming or offensive security testing is seen as essential in testing the security posture of
organisations.

## **So, what is the difference between Blue Team and Red Team?**

Blue Teams are defenders, typically members of a SOC, they will monitor and look for threats,
they will then act on threats, in a way they are reactive in nature, they are waiting for things to
happen.
Red Teams are proactive, will simulate real attackers and will attempt to penetrate defences
undetected. Their role is to highlight holes in defences and to improve detection capabilities for
Blue Team.

### Red Teams are used in two ways

● External independent testing

● Internal in-house team

External independent pen testing teams can be engaged in different capacities depending on a clients requirements, these can include but are not limited to:

● **Physical :**

    ○ Testing physical access to buildings, this includes to staff areas  infrastructure eg. heating/utilities, data centres

    ○ Social Engineering/impersonation

    ○ Lockpicking

    ○ Security control evasion

● **Social Engineering :**

    ○ Phishing attacks

    ○ Impersonation

    ○ Tailgating

    ○ Drop Attack

● **Network Infrastructure :**

    ○ Firewall bypass

    ○ Router testing/configuration

    ○ DNS footprinting

    ○ Proxy Servers

    ○ Vulnerability exploits

    ○ Configuration

● **Web application compromise and exploitation – physical and Cloud**

● **Wireless**

    ○ Configuration

    ○ Unauthorised access points

    ○ Default passwords

    ○ Encryption protocols

● **Application testing – databases, - physical and Cloud :**

● **Operating system build standards**
    ○ Server

    ○ Desktop

    ○ Mobile
● **IOT**

In security we have the stop the bad guys 100% of the time, while the bad guys only have to
succeed once. The pressure is therefore on Blue to succeed in detection. Red plays a pivotal role
in assisting Blue in the process of improving their processes and detections.
